                Introduction to Web Development
            </div>

            <div class="post-body">
                <p>Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.

<p>The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!</p>

<p>In fact, many argue it’s the best form of coding for beginners to learn. It’s easy to set up, you get instant results and there’s plenty of online training available.</p>

<p>A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But itâ€™s also a good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding, since itâ€™s super easy to get started. No matter whether youâ€™re looking for a career or just want to learn coding, learning how to develop for the web is for you. Itâ€™s one of the smartest decisions you will ever make!</p>

<p>Web Development Overview</p>
<p>There are two broad divisions of web development â€“ front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).</p>

<p>Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application â€“ the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes â€“ HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for â€˜marking upâ€™ text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language thatâ€™s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.</p>

<p>Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example. Say you log into your Facebook account, and you are greeted with the latest updates in your News Feed. Theyâ€™re not going to be the same updates that you saw yesterday.</p>

<p>How did the page change? Did a Facebook employee manually edit the page to update your news feed? Of course not. A script on the Facebook back-end would have received the updates and re-generated the front-end accordingly.</p>

<p>Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such asâ€¦</p>

PHP
Ruby on Rails
ASP.NET
Perl
Java
Node.js
Python
Without going into more detail, thatâ€™s really all there is to web development. So now, here are the best ways to start learning it.

<p>Ways to Learn Web Development</p>
<p>The traditional way to learn web development is to enroll in a university or trade school course. However, it can be costly â€“ and whatâ€™s more, the web evolves so fast that schools often canâ€™t keep up!

<p>Luckily, there’s plenty of good quality coding training available here on the Internet. What better place to learn web development than the web itself?</p>

<p>Teach It To Yourself</p>
<p>You could also learn web coding by researching it on your own, tweaking website templates and inspecting the source code of other websites. A lot of coders learn HTML and CSS this way, using website editing software to tweak a website template and figuring out the code.</p>

<p>However, this method is not ideal. It takes a very long time, and you don’t even know what there is to learn. Itâ€™s like having to first find the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle before you can assemble them.</p>
